## Publication design essays (45%)

You will be graded on three brief essays. You must submit three, but can submit up to five, of which we will count the best three. These essays are open ended but should include: (1) explanatory text written for a scholarly but non-technical audience that frames issues of digital scholarship and publishing and argues a worthwhile point; (2) any tables, visualizations, or design elements to help argue that point; (3) citations. These can come to us in any form. If you have ideas on how you want to accomplish something, come to us and we will provide the direction and support you need.

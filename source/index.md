How might visualization tools effect the way Humanities scholars work in the digital age? Humanities research relies increasingly on digitized source material and, consequently, on data visualization as an interface for organizing and assessing as well as analyzing information. We will explore different ways of thinking about data visually, using visualization software under development to discover themes, questions and relationships. In an age where visual forms hold the force of persuasion, data visualization skills not only shape arguments but also help researchers engage critically with the information behind their analyses. Humanities+Design investigates the role of the humanities in the challenges of interpreting and presenting data---especially "big data." Each student will participate in the design of visualization tools for humanities research, learning about the design process and design theory as it applies to digital humanities research. 

In this course, you will be introduced to theoretical and practical problems of publishing born-digital scholarship in the humanities.

## Software

Computers will be central to the course. Please plan on bringing a computer to each class.

-   You will need access to the Linux command line, which you can access on any Apple or Linux computer. Windows users, you will need to install [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/).
-   Much of your work will go on [GitHub](http://github.com). Sign up for an account.
-   We won't be using email or Canvas. Instead, [Slack](http://slack.com/) will be our environment for communication, sharing, and questions. We recommend downloading one of their [applications](http://slack.com/downloads). We will get you set up on Slack on the first meeting of the quarter.
-   Get a good text editor. On Mac, [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) are great options. On Windows, [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) work great. Or you can use the [One True text editor](http://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/vi/), [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), but it has a steep learning curve. We'd recommend getting [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/), as it doesn't mess up CSV files the way Excel does.

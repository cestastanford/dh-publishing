How do digital research practices effect the Humanities research process? From reading to writing, from review to publication, Humanities research relies increasingly on digital workfows. Keeping track of new software that promises to make writing easier, only to dissolve into oblivion before you've completed the second chapter of your dissertation is maddening. In this course you will learn the foundational tools of digital writing and design your own digital research process. In this course, you will be introduced to theoretical and practical problems of publishing born-digital scholarship in the humanities.

## Software

Computers will be central to the course. Please plan on bringing a computer to each class.

-   You will need access to the Linux command line, which you can access on any Apple or Linux computer. Windows users, you will need to install [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/).
-   Much of your work will go on [GitHub](http://github.com). Sign up for an account.
-   We won't be using email or Canvas. Instead, [Slack](http://slack.com/) will be our environment for communication, sharing, and questions. We recommend downloading one of their [applications](http://slack.com/downloads). We will get you set up on Slack on the first meeting of the quarter.
-   Get a good text editor. On Mac, [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) are great options. On Windows, [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) work great. Or you can use the [One True text editor](http://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/vi/), [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), but it has a steep learning curve. We'd recommend getting [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/), as it doesn't mess up CSV files the way Excel does.
